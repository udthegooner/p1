# p1

1. Hey everyone! This is the repository for p1. If you're relatively new to github (like me) https://guides.github.com/ can be a good place to get up and running.
2. Just to get things started, I have uploaded my files for p0. According to me everything is working fine. Feel free to suggest changes, point out errors and clarify stuff if the commenting isn't good enough.
3. Config, Test_GradeEstimator and ScoreListADt are files that have been given to us for p1. These do not need to be submitted and cannot be changed.
